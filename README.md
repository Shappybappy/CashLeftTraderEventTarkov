# CashLeftTraderEventTarkov
a web scraper to see how much money is left to get traders back in tarkov.
It also takes about 0.36209111332893373 seconds to go through one loop through the program

# NOTE
this has legit no use now aside from a reference for creating python webscrappers, the event is over and the page it was scrapping has been taken down.
It was fun while it lasted

# notice
you do need to download python3 and beatiful soup 4 and selenium along with downloading a chromium driver and changing 'your driver path' well to your driver path
